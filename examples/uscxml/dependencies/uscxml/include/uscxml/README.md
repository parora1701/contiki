## What is it?

uSCXML is a platform to work with state-charts given as
[SCXML](http://www.w3.org/TR/scxml/) files. It consists of three principal components:

 1. `libuscxml`: [C++ library](#embedded-as-a-library) containing an interpreter and accompanying functionality.

 2. `uscxml-browser`: A standards compliant [command-line interpreter](#on-the-command-line) of SCXML documents.
 
 3. `uscxml-transform`: A collection of [transformation](#for-transformations) implementations to transpile SCXML, e.g. onto ANSI-C and VHDL.

The status of the various datamodels, bindings and generators with regard to the [W3C IRP
tests](https://www.w3.org/Voice/2013/scxml-irp/) can be checked in the [test
table](test/w3c/TESTS.md).

## Installation

There are no installers yet and we do not feature any releases. Just check for [open issues](https://github.com/tklab-tud/uscxml/issues) and [build from source](http://tklab-tud.github.io/uscxml/building.html). If you did download and build locally, you can create installers via `make packages` though.

## Documentation

Documentation is available at our [github pages](http://tklab-tud.github.io/uscxml/). It is created from inline comments in the source along with some dedicated markdown pages via `doxygen`. We try to keep it current and will update it ever again. For the most current documentation, you can run `make docs` in your build directory.

## Licensing

uSCXML itself is distributed under the [Simplified BSD license](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license) as in, do not sue
us and do not misrepresent authorship. There are currently four additional libraries that are required to compile uSCXML.

| Project | License | Comment |
|---------|---------|---------|
| [libcurl](https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/) | [MIT/X derivate](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/copyright.html) | Used in uSCXML to fetch remote content |
| [Xerces-C++](https://xerces.apache.org/xerces-c/) | [Apache v2](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html) | XML parser and DOM implementation |
| [libevent](http://libevent.org) | [3-clause BSD](http://libevent.org/LICENSE.txt) | Delayed event queues |
| [uriparser](http://uriparser.sourceforge.net) | [New BSD](https://sourceforge.net/p/uriparser/git/ci/master/tree/COPYING) | Referring and resolving URIs |

At configure time, the uSCXML build-process will attempt to find and link several other libraries (e.g. Lua, v8) and additional licensing terms may apply.

## Getting Started

For more detailled information, refer to the [documentation](http://tklab-tud.github.io/uscxml).

### Embedded as a Library
    uscxml::Interpreter scxml = uscxml::Interpreter::fromURL("...");
    while(scxml.step() != uscxml::USCXML_FINISHED) {
      ...
    }

### On the Command-line
    # interpret state-chart from url
    $ uscxml-browser https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tklab-tud/uscxml/master/test/w3c/null/test436.scxml

### For Transformations
    # transform given SCXML document into ANSI-C fragment
    $ uscxml-transform -tc -i https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tklab-tud/uscxml/master/test/w3c/null/test436.scxml
